# Install

Getting The Lazarus Project is as simple as follows:

```
wget -qO- goo.gl/0emHna | sudo bash
```

This should work on all fresh Ubuntu systems with no prior dependencies.

Once The Lazarus Project is installed, setup the desired layers in `lazarus.layers`, and then install with:

```
sudo ./main.py
```
